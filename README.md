##  Overview

This project explores bacterial population dynamics through both **computational simulations** (*in silico*) and **laboratory experiments** using *Escherichia coli*. The study compares two fundamental ecological models:

- **Exponential Growth Model**: Unlimited resource scenario
- **Logistic Growth Model**: Resource-limited scenario with carrying capacity

The project investigates how environmental factors (pH and nutrient concentration) affect bacterial growth parameters (r and K).

---

##  Objectives

1. Simulate exponential and logistic growth using iterative numerical methods
2. Analyze the effects of parameters (r, K, Nâ‚€) on population dynamics
3. Validate theoretical models with experimental data
4. Investigate environmental impacts on bacterial growth
5. Develop practical skills in ecological modeling and data analysis

##  Key Findings

### Effect of Growth Rate (r)
- Higher r â†’ faster population growth and quicker approach to carrying capacity
- Biologically represents metabolic efficiency and resource quality
- Optimal conditions (pH 7.0, full nutrients) yielded highest r values

### Effect of Carrying Capacity (K)
- K determines maximum sustainable population size
- Directly correlated with nutrient concentration
- Independent of initial population size

### Environmental Impacts
- **pH 7.0** (neutral): Optimal for *E. coli* enzyme function
- **pH 5.0/8.5**: Reduced growth rates due to protein denaturation
- **Nutrient dilution**: Proportionally reduced carrying capacity

### Model Validation
- Logistic model accurately describes bacterial growth curves
- Good fit with experimental data (RÂ² > 0.95 in most cases)
- Deviations observed in extreme pH conditions
